            What is a Tech Chad 10x Developer Brogrammer?
          </h1>
          <p class="what-is--text">
            A Tech Chad 10x developer Brogrammer meditates daily, wakes up at 5
            AM, is jacked, and most importantly, codes at 10x the speed of a
            normal developer. He codes this fast due to his dedication to his
            craft. He shows everyone that it's 100% possible to be an all-around
            human being, and that it is important. He also takes craps while
            standing and is able to control his internal body temperature.

            It all starts with the right mindset. They know that every outside
            journey must start from within. This journey is not like any other
            journey. The struggles of computer science equates to a more
            meaningful life as well as more stress. It is ultimately up to you
            to take on the task. Give yourself a reason for Computer Science to
            be your passion. For me, it is because it <i>embodies</i> the
            meaning of life. It requires constant learning on the job and it is
            constantly evolving. You will be compensated well for the value you
            provide to this world. You deserve it.

          Starting in March of 2022, I made an oath to myself to wake up at 5 am
          every weekday for the rest of my life. Non negotiable, it has totally
          revolutionized my life and the direction of it. All of the neurons in
          my brain look at reality in a positive lense. I feel the most alive;
          the most aligned with the energy of the Earth's heartbeat. Nothing
          matters more to me than becoming the best version of myself in ALL
          AREAS OF LIFE. Physical, emotional/social, mental, spiritual,
          financial, environmental, etc. My goal on this Earth is to be
          maximally synergistic. To contribute so much value to this Earth that
          it creates a self reinforcing cycle of recycling and regrowth, just
          like a plant. My influence on the people around me will be multi
          generational.
