            What is a Tech Chad 10x Developer Brogrammer?
          </h1>
          <p class="what-is--text">
            A Tech Chad 10x developer Brogrammer meditates daily, wakes up at 5
            AM, is jacked, and most importantly, codes at 10x the speed of a
            normal developer. He codes this fast due to his dedication to his
            craft. He shows everyone that it's 100% possible to be an all-around
            human being, and that it is important. He also takes craps while
            standing.

            It all starts with the right mindset. They know that every outside
            journey must start from within. This journey is not like any other
            journey. The struggles of computer science equates to a more
            meaningful life as well as more stress. It is ultimately up to you
            to take on the task. Give yourself a reason for Computer Science to
            be your passion. For me, it is because it <i>embodies</i> the
            meaning of life. It requires constant learning on the job and it is
            constantly evolving. You will be compensated well for the value you
            provide to this world. You deserve it.
